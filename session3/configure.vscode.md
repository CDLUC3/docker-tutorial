The following step is optional but recommended. We will spend a few minutes in Session 3 exploring VSCode Docker features.

## Install VSCode
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open VSCode
- Click "Open Folder"
- Open this repository in VSCode

## Installing Recommended Workspace Extensions
- A prompt may appear in the lower right corner asking if you want to install recommended workspace extensions
  - Click "Install" to install them
- Otherwise, click "Extensions" in the ribbon on the left side
  - Search for "@recommended" at the top of the Extension panel
    - We have recommended [~7 extensions](https://github.com/CDLUC3/docker-tutorial/blob/main/.vscode/extensions.json#L7-L13) including
      - Docker
      - Remote - Containers
      - YAML
  - You will see a panel named "Workspace Recommendations"
  - Install any extensions that are not already installed.  We will use these in the exercises.

## Confirm Extensions are in place  
After the installations are complete, you will see 2 changes to your editor
- The ribbon the the left side of the screen will contain a "Docker" button
- Your lower left corner of you window will contain a green box that can "Open a Remote Window"
