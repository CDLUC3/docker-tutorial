The following step is optional but recommended. We will spend a few minutes in Session 3 exploring VSCode Docker features.
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open VSCode
- Click "Open Folder"
- Open this repository in VSCode

Installing Recommended Workspace Extensions
- A prompt may appear in the lower right corner asking if you want to install recommended workspace extensions
  - Click "Install" to install them
- Otherwise, click "Extensions" in the ribbon on the left side
  - Search for "@recommended" at the top of the Extension panel
  - You will see a panel named "Workspace Recommendations"
  - Install any extensions that are not already installed.  We will use these in the exercises.
