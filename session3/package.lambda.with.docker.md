This lesson relies on knowledge of UC3 systems.

UC3 currently runs 2 applications as AWS Lambdas.  These applications are deployed to Lambda as Docker Images.

The same Docker Images can be tested with Docker Compose prior to deployment.

See [Packaging a Lambda as a Docker Image -- Merritt Admin Tool](https://github.com/CDLUC3/mrt-admin-lambda)
