## Stop and delete any running containers

```
docker ps -a
```

Note the names of any remaining containers
```output

```
docker stop mydb
```

If the containers were not started with `--rm`, then run the following to remove them
```
docker rm mydb
```

## Delete the docker network
```
docker network ls
```

Look for `mynet`.

If mynet exists, delete it
